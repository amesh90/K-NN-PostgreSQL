# k-Nearest-Neighbor-PostgreSQL

Extending PostgreSQL with spatial ranking predicates, mainly k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN). The objective is to extend PostgreSQL (open-source DBMS) to process a combination of location-based operations intermixed with relational operations to handle complex user queries. 

This is a development version.
